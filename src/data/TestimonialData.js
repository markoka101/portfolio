		review: `I had the pleasure of working with Mark Oka, and I can confidently say that his
                                skills in building and managing my portfolio website were exceptional. Mark's
                                ability to turn my concepts into a polished, functional, and visually appealing
                                online presence is truly impressive. Mark demonstrated a remarkable understanding of
                                both design and technical aspects. He skillfully built a comprehensive portfolio
                                website for me, ensuring that every detail and requested I had was meticulously
                                attended toâ€”from the initial design concept to the final launch. His approach to
                                integrating user-friendly features, such as window scaling plus making it
                                mobile-friendly, was first rate. He ensured that the overall design and loading
                                times were responsive and made the website not only attractive but also highly
                                functional across various devices.`
